                    <br>
                    men’s clothing would eventually evolve into what it is today. Dragging and slashing was another one of the Renaissance era’s decorative techniques that was used to distinguish and beautify men’s garments (levanter). But as seen in today’s fashion Calvin Kline is a major designer. He created a classic man’s silhouette which was made by using more interesting fabric’s and unique details (Billet 3). Kline has become one of the most common designers worn today.

                            Originally an undergarment worn exclusively by men, it has become, in American English, a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments.

A shirt can also be worn with a necktie under the shirt collar. <br>Shirts and Tshirts are very important part of fashion culture for both men and womens.
